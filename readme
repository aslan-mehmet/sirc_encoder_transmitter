Simple Sirc Encoder/Transmitter

description
        minimal code size and intterrupt driven.

how it works
        it uses irtim that avaliable on stm32f0 devices. irtim works with two
timers; tim17(carrier) and tim16(envelope). please be aware sirc_encode_init
function contains some assumed reset values. encoding done with envelope timer's
interrupt. when encoding done I close the timers, pull high ir pin, wait so
received handles send frame.

hardware
        at the end of irtim timer there is nand gate. I use not gate(single
transistor) to convert that into and. after that I put another transistor to
drive infrared leds.
