SIMPLE SIRC ENCODER/TRANSMITTER

description
        simple sony infrared protocol encoder and very small code size.

how it works
        it uses irtim that avaliable on stm32f0 devices. irtim works with two
timers; tim17(carrier) and tim16(envelope). please be aware sirc_encode_init
function contains some assumed reset values. encoding done with envelope timer's
interrupt. when encoding done I close the timers and pull high ir pin.

hardware
        at the end of irtim timer there is nand gate. I use not gate(single
transistor) to convert that into and. after that I put another transistor to
drive infrared leds.
